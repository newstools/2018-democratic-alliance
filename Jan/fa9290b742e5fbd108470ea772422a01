This morning DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Nomsa Marchesi MP, met with the Principal of Fisantekraal Secondary School, which was ranked among the most improved schools in the Western Cape. The DA undertook the visit to look at the state of school readiness ahead of schools opening tomorrow. Last year, Fisantekraal increased their pass rate by 14.7% in the past year, despite the numerous challenges it had to face. The principal and teachers of the school put in a tremendous amount of effort into ensuring that their Matrics are prepared to write their exams, including teaching extra classes on a Saturday and provides plenty of extramural activities for all Grades. They also have the support of an active community and School Governing Body (SGB), again highlighting the vital role that SGBs play in ensuring the success of a school. The principal also appreciated the support provided by the Western Cape Education Department (WCED), which has worked tirelessly to improve basic education in the province and the school is an example of the positive policies it has undertaken to ensure this. Most importantly, the school is looking always to continuously improve â€“ their focus for the coming year is specialised support in Maths and Science. Such aspiration and dedication is a shining example for other school leaders to follow. Every child has the right to quality basic education and without adequate institutional support, our children will be deprived of bright futures and will struggle to be absorbed into the labour force. It is precisely for this reason that the DA will ensure that there is a sustained improvement of pass rates in our schools.

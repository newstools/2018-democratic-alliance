The DA is deeply saddened by the passing of our national treasure, Hugh Masekela. We extend our love and condolences to his family, loved ones and the South African music fraternity. His unmistakable sound will echo in our hearts forever. Bra Hugh was more than just a Jazz musician, he was a musical genius and a fearless activist. His music told the stories of our people and reflected the struggles of black South Africans opposing apartheid. His music reflected the difficult realities of life in the township but also brought to life the vibrant spirit of Sophiatown. His sound would later go on to inspire the sounds of musicians across the musical spectrum. Bra Hugh was a giant among his peers. His music touched the lives of true music lovers, irrespective of colour or creed. We all sang and danced to Thanayi and songs such as Stimela made us all contemplative. Bra Hugh was a proud African and a true son of the soil. We are grateful for his immense contribution to South Africa and the continent as a whole. Our nation owes you a great debt of gratitude, Bra Hugh. Rest in peace, Bra Hugh. We will miss you!

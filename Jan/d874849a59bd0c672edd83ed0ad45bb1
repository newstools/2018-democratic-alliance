African National Congress (ANC) Councillor and former MMC of Housing, Dan Bovu, and his accomplice have been arrested for the illegal sale of a City owned property stand in Vlakfontein, South of Johannesburg. The pair handed themselves over to the police in Lenasia this morning. Councillor Bovu served as the Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Housing under the previous administration led by Cllr Parks Tau. Bovu currently serves as Councillor for the ANC as well as its Regional Deputy Secretary General in Johannesburg and was a ward Councillor when he allegedly committed the crime in 2006. The suspects will appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court today where they will be charged with fraud and corruption. Upon coming into office, the DA-led multi-party coalition government became aware of this case, and tabled a motion before Council in September 2017. This act of fraud and corruption from within the ranks of the ANC comes as no surprise to the new administration. Read the full statement from Mayor Mashaba here

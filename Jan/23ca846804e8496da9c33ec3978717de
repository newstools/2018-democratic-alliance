The DA welcomes the long-overdue resignation of ESKOM Chairperson, Zethemba Khoza. However, his resignation does not absolve him of the role he played in ESKOM’s decline and the DA will not allow Khoza, or any other person implicated in corruption at state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or State Capture, to escape the consequences. It is imperative that there is no unnecessary delay in the appointment of a new ESKOM Chair and CEO. We cannot allow speculation to do even more damage to our besieged energy utility. Khoza’s resignation and the leadership vacuum at ESKOM once again shows Minister Lynn Brown’s complete inability to manage our SOEs. The appointment of suitable and capable Chairperson and CEO is only the first step in helping ESKOM recover from the chronic mismanagement and looting which has brought the parastatal to the brink of collapse.

The DA welcomes the news that the Cape Town Cycle Tour will go ahead as planned and that its organisers will contribute two million litres of spring water to the cityâ€™s grid in order to ensure that the event is water neutral. The Tour organisers will ensure that water is used responsibly by using locally-produced desalinated water for all cleaning purposes and bringing in drinking water from outside the Western Cape. The water stations along the route will also be reduced to 14. We commend the efforts of the Cape Town Cycle Tour team and are confident that this will encourage the visitors and residents of Cape Town and the Western Cape to save water. It is important that all people living in or visiting our vibrant city adhere to the water restrictions so that we can all defeat Day Zero together. There will be 15 000 local and international cyclists participating in the Tour and the event brings in about R500 million into the Western Cape economy. In addition to its positive impact on the provincial economy, the Cape Town Cycle Tour will benefit residents by boosting sports tourism, despite the harsh effects of the drought we are experiencing. The DA-led Western Cape administration will continue to seek such initiatives for the benefit of its residents and do everything in its power to ensure that we defeat Day Zero by working together.

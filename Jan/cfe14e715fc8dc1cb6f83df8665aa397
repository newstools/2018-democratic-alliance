Reports seemingly show that former PRASA CEO, Lucky Montana, presided over a more extensive corrupt network at the parastatal during his tenure than initially thought. According to the reports, Makhensa Mabunda, a former friend and colleague of his, allegedly received kickbacks of R75 Million to secure a lucrative contract in 2014/15. The DA will submit this new evidence to the Police to widen the scope of their ongoing investigation into the charges we laid against Mr Montana on 9 September 2016 and 7 December 2017 on the locomotive tender. We will also ask for an update from the Hawks on the progress of this investigation, in which Mabunda is implicated. In the latest expose, it is alleged that R75 million was paid to Mabunda’s S-Investment company for “consulting fees” that was not disclosed by the Spanish manufacturer, Vossloh España, which was contracted to manufacture trains for Swifambo Rail Leasing. The allegations are that these bribes were paid to enable Swifambo Rail Leasing to secure the controversial Afro4000 Locomotive tender, whose locomotives have been involved in several derailments due to their dimensions being too large for South African Railways. The constant flow of new evidence on corrupt activities at PRASA under Montana again emphasises the lack of progress into investigations on state capture at the entity. Since the release of the Public Protector’s “Derailed” report into corruption in 2015, both the Minister and PRASA have effectively brought the recommended investigations to a halt. It has become untenable for our law enforcement agencies to continue turning a blind eye to this mounting evidence of corruption at PRASA under Lucky Montana. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s supposed ‘crusade’ against corruption will continue to be meaningless until serious action is taken against those who have enriched themselves through taxpayers money.

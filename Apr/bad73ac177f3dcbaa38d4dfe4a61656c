Yesterday, Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, delivered 94 title deeds to the community of Finetown in Ennerdale. This forms part of the 795 title deeds which will be issued over the course of the month of April. The City of Jozi is undertaking to provide dignity of a home through inner-city development projects. It is estimated that some 30 000 accommodation units are required in the short term to address the needs of the most vulnerable households. The City has conducted an audit of some 500 bad buildings, 84 of which are confirmed as hijacked. 24 of the 500 bad buildings belong to the City. All of these buildings represent opportunities for creating affordable housing. In response to this urgent need, Council has made 13 buildings available for the purpose of creating quality low-cost income housing towards inner-city development. The City continues to work tirelessly to roll out the provision of quality housing to residents. It is through working collectively with all sectors of society that residents of the City of Johannesburg will have access to inclusive housing that creates safe, clean and connected communities with access to economic opportunities that transform our communities.

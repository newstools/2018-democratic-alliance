Democratic Alliance Ancillary Bodies, DA Youth and DA Women’s Network, today convened for its joint Federal Congress in Tshwane and elected new leadership structures. The joint congress took place at the Velmore Hotel & Spa and hosted hundreds of delegates from across the country. DAWN elected Dr Nomafrench Mbombo as its Federal Leader and Safiyia Stanfley as the Deputy Federal DAWN Leader. The DA Youth elected Luyolo Mphithi as its Federal Youth Leader, while Zahid Badroodien was elected as Federal Youth Chairperson. The DA prides itself with our record of conducting free and fair elections and this congress has been no different. Dr Mbombo is currently the Western Cape Minister of Health and holds a doctorate in Gender and Human Rights, a Masters in Maternal and Child Health, and a Bachelors degree in nursing. Mr Mphithi is a former Councillor in the City of Johannesburg, a Mandela Rhodes scholar as well as a Mandela Washington fellow and one of the Mail & Guardian’s Top 200 young persons in South Africa, 2017. Both these leaders have a proven track record of service in the DA’s party structures. They have demonstrated that they are dedicated and fearless leaders who have the passion necessary to help build South Africa into one nation with one future that is based on our core values of freedom, fairness and opportunity for all. As the DA looks to achieving our best results yet in the 2019 elections, we are pleased to have this calibre of leaders join our fight to build One South African for All.

The DA Students Organisation (DASO) yet again made history after emerging victorious in yesterday’s University of Fort Hare’s Student Representative Council (SRC) elections. In so doing DASO wrestled control of the SRC away from the ANC-aligned SASCO. In 2015 DASO made history when it won control of the UFH SRC for the very first time. UFH students have grown increasingly confident in DASO student leaders, who show commitment to fighting for better student conditions and increased access. DASO is now governing the historic Alice campus and also holds the majority of the seats in the Institutional SRC – which is the highest decision-making body. The DA congratulates DASO for bringing total change to the University of Fort Hare. DASO would like to thank all of the students at Fort Hare who came out to support the DA and will now work tirelessly in leading the SRC to champion the pressing issues facing UFH students.

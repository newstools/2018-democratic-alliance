The DA grew from 28.81% to 33.14% in the ward 92 by-election in Joburg yesterday. We welcome these results as a testament to the Party’s goal of winning this province in 2019. We contested four by-elections in Joburg and Tshwane yesterday. These took place in wards 92, 88 and 72 in Joburg as well as in ward 47 in Tshwane. Further to the encouraging results that we saw in ward 92, we also grew from 82.67% to 91.69% in ward 72 while support remained consistent in ward 88 at 79.66%. In Tshwane we grew from 87.67% to 95.18% of voter support. We are encouraged by these results because as they signal the growing trust the people of South Africa have in our ability to govern and change their lives for the better. We are the only party that can bring about Total Change in Gauteng. The ANC built a corrupt system to feed themselves and it is the people who paid the price. While it won’t happen overnight, people are seeing significant progress happen as DA-led governments spare no effort in undoing the damage that was done by a self-serving ANC. DA-led governments are prioritizing better service delivery, greater access to opportunities and the fight against corruption,  so that we can help our people live a life they value. I am thankful to each and every resident who came out and voted for the DA yesterday. We remain committed to our cause of bringing Total Change that builds one South Africa for All.

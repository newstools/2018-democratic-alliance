The Democratic Alliance (DA) strongly condemns the violence that erupted at Moses Mabhida stadium soon after Kaizer Chiefs lost in the semi-final match of the Nedbank Cup to Free State Stars which left many people injured and property damaged. Stadium management, football marshalls, Premier Soccer League (PSL) leadership and the South Africa police service (SAPS) must provide answers on why security measures they had in place failed which then saw fans invade the pitch unhindered. I will write to the Portfolio Committee Chairperson on Sports, Ms Beauty Dlulane, requesting that he summon the Premier Soccer League (PSL) leadership to account for the growing culture of violence that seems to have taken root in the countryâ€™s premier soccer division. The PSL must provide concrete plans on interventions they will be implementing to stop violence at football matches and ensure safety of spectators and officials. It is not acceptable that a family spectator sport regularly degenerates to violence that threatens the well-being of everyone, because the PSL fails to take stern action against hooligans who perpetuate violence. Failure to adequately deal with unacceptable behavior comes only weeks after the dropping of the PSL Commission of Inquiry into crowd safety by Minister Tokozile Xasa. The events at Moses Mabhida shows that this was an ill-informed decision that proves that crowd safety at major sporting events is not a priority for government. Parliament must fulfill its role and hold sporting bodies, such as the PSL, accountable to ensure that South African stadiums do not become death traps for sport loving fans.

The DA welcomes the withdrawal by the Presidency of their appeal against the court judgement ordering former President Jacob Zuma to personally pay the legal costs, estimated at R10 million, for trying to block the release the State of Capture report. While this is a victory for ordinary South Africans who have been made to pay for the ANC’s mistakes for far too long, the question of who will pay the R15.3 million in legal fees pertaining to the ‘Spy Tapes’ decade-long saga, still remains. In March, the DA filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court asking the court to declare that the agreement between the Presidency and Jacob Zuma, to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution be reviewed, declared invalid and set aside. We also requested that the court order that the R15.3 million already spent on the litigation be refunded. Zuma has already cost our country dearly. Ensuring that he personally pays the cost of his frivolous legal fees for the State capture report is only half the battle. The DA will continue with our application to ensure that R15.3 million already spent on ducking and diving is refunded and that Zuma is not given a single cent more for his coming criminal trial, now set for 8 June 2018.

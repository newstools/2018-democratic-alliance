The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in the North West on Friday in reaction to the violence, which has arisen as a response to Supra Mahumapelo’s continued leadership. The only action that will end the scenes of war is for ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa to announce the recall of Mahumapelo, whose time as Premier has been marked by recurring allegations of corruption, a close relationship with the Guptas and a general collapse of the North West. We condemn violence of any kind, it is clear however that the frustration arises from a failure of leadership and governance at all levels – from service delivery to education; from health to housing. At a time when the ANC and Ramaphosa play politics, lives have been lost and Mahikeng burns. The ANC has again chosen to defend an individual at the expense of the people. In the same way that South Africa punished the ANC at the polls for protecting Jacob Zuma, the people of the North West will punish them for keeping Mahumapelo in power. If the ANC and Ramaphosa cared about the people, Mahumapelo would have been fired long ago. Ramaphosa’s new dawn is quickly fading as the people who are continually failed by the ANC, face the reality that of an ANC with a new leader who will not act in a time of crisis. The people of the North West deserve better than the ANC; the people of the North West deserve total change under a DA-led government which will always put them first by ensuring the delivery of quality services, the administration healthcare and a caring government.

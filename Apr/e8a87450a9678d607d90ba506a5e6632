Since taking over the City of Johannesburg, Mayor Herman Mashaba has committed his administration to transforming Johannesburg’s inner city to make it a prosperous, inclusive and safe place for residents to live and work. So far, under Mayor Mashaba’s leadership, the City has made massive inroads into the scourge of property hijackings in the inner city. A total of 29 successful operations have resulted in the return of 24 properties back to their rightful owners, 530 suspects arrested, and 84 hijacked buildings raided.

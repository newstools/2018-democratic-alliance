On Saturday, 7 April, DA Leader Mmusi Maimane confronted racist remarks, alleging that he is not in control of the DA and merely a puppet. He criticized the ANC’s fear of a new generation of black leaders who would reject the ANC’s own nationalism and think differently.  Maimane stressed further that his blackness does not add or subtract from his humanity or define him. He calls for a new agenda for African liberalism that prioritises social welfare and grows the economy in order to lift the majority of South Africans out of poverty.

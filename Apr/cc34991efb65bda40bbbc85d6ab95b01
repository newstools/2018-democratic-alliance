The DA stands ready to oppose a proposal by the EFF to establish a “state bank”, not only because it is a bad idea but also because it is in effect a “dead duck” which will do nothing to help the unbanked whom it purports to serve. The EFF’s memorandum for the establishment of a “state bank” has been published in the government gazette. The draft Bill is yet to be tabled but past EFF communication on the idea of a state bank, which closely mirrors that of the ANC, has shown the idea to be financially incoherent, hypocritical, redundant and thus doomed to fail.

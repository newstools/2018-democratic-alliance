The DA welcomes the decision by the Minister of State Security, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba, to reinstate the security clearance of the Inspector-General of intelligence, Dr Setlhomamaru Dintwe. It is now absolutely critical that the Minister and the Acting Director-General of the State Security Agency, Loyiso Jafta, cooperate with the IGI so that he can expedite and conclude his investigation into illicit activities at the State Security Agency. Arthur Fraser‘s conduct during his tenure at the SSA as Director-General must be fully investigated and he must be held to account for his potentially criminal conduct. The DA echoes the calls to protect the IGI from any undue interference in the execution of his constitutional mandate during this investigative process. While now only a portion of the IGI’s initial court application remains for consideration before the High Court as a result of the reinstatement of his security clearance, this case must be allowed to proceed. The country’s intelligence laws are in dire need of review in order to improve accountability and oversight mechanisms. The DA reiterates its call for President Cyril Ramaphosa and State Security Minister Letsatsi-Duba to reclaim South Africa’s intelligence services in the interests of our national security – those who have long been allowed to abuse our national security must be exposed and prosecuted.

The DA has submitted an application to the Essential Services Committee (ESC) to have a minimum service level declared for school staff. Every year, schools across the country are afflicted by strikes which have a negative impact on learners. It is the duty of school staff to care for and protect children in the absence of parents and guardians. However, when they are away on strike or at trade union meetings during school hours, the safety and security of children is compromised. We are submitting three key concerns to the ESC in requesting a minimum service level declaration: We have included the request for the establishment of a minimum service level for school staff as one of our demands for school safety. The demands can be viewed in our letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa, which South Africans can co-sign at https://protectourchildren.co.za/. Learners deserve to learn in a safe environment and the establishment of a minimum service level by the ESC would go a long way to ensuring the well-being and safety of children.

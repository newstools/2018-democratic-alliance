A housing demand survey carried out in the City of Tshwane central business district and surrounding areas suggests that there is an immediate need for 18 000 and 30 000 new residential units, including affordable, social housing. As part of its plans to meet this growing demand, the City launched a R300 million Thembelihle Village Social Housing Project in the Tshwane inner city.  Completed in November 2017, with first occupation in February 2018, the project targets people in the low to medium income bracket and who earn between R3 500 and R15 000 a month. With rent for a bachelor apartment starting as low as R700 a month, the project is providing affordable quality homes to low-income earners nearer their place of work. The ‘Thembelihle’ Village, which means ‘good hope’, is also located close to government departments, other places of work, shops, social amenities and public transport.

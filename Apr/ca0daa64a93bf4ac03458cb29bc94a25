I would like to congratulate the Mayor of DA-run Midvaal, Bongani Baloyi and his team for once again being rated the highest scoring local municipality in Gauteng regarding its financial stability. Rating’s Afrika’s Municipal Financial Stability Index for 2017 saw Midvaal walk away with a rating of 68/100. This is higher than the average for Gauteng which has a stability score of 30. It is also higher than the national average which sits at 44. Since the DA took office in Midvaal, the municipality has gone from strength to strength, improving the quality of life for its residents. Espousing the values underscored by the DA’s position on good governance, Midvaal has exercised prudent financial governance and continues to be a shining example of the DA difference. Come 2019, the residents of Gauteng will be afforded the opportunity to extend this style of government to a provincial level. Through our commitment to foster a people-centred government, the DA will bring this change to all residents of Gauteng. A brighter future is on its way.

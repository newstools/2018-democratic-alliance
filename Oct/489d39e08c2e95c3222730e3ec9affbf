The DA notes the resignation of 5 councillors from the City of Cape Town caucus. We will await a full report from our caucus leadership in the City. We wish them luck in their future endeavours. We look forward to the Mayor-Elect, Dan Plato, to bring much-needed stability, unity of purpose and mature leadership. Our focus always has been delivering to the residents of Cape Town, the people who elected us.

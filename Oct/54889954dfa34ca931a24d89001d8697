The Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape welcomes the announcement by the World Bank, through its ‘Doing Business in South Africa’ report, that the City of Cape Town is the top opportunity city in Africa. It is a confirmation of the City’s commitment to provide better services to residents and create an enabling environment for businesses to flourish, while creating fair access to jobs. While we are proud of our track record in government, I want to echo Mayor Patricia De Lille’s sentiment that we must not become complacent and continue to do all we can to provide residents with better access to opportunities. That is why when I become Mayor I will ensure that we build on the successes of the City and strengthen our ties with the Western Cape Provincial Government so that innovative programmes that address the challenges our people face, can be driven across the Metro. The continued success of Cape Town lies within our ability to work together. The safety of the communities across the city needs to be addressed immediately. Sadly, the management of the South African Police Service (SAPS) is the mandate of the failing ANC National Government. But this will not deter us from doing all we can to keep our people safe. I will work very closely with Alderman JP Smith, to support his department and the safety initiatives they champion. Affordable housing close to the city will also be at the top of my priority list so that more people can access opportunities. I will join Premier Helen Zille in her call to the ANC-led National Government to release the Ysterplaat land to the Provincial Government so that people can be provided with housing opportunities. This site can provide and estimated 18 000 affordable housing units. The DA-led City of Cape Town has made great progress and together we will be able to do more so that every resident of Cape Town is able to live their best life.

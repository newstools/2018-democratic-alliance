Allegations pointing to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s prior knowledge of the large-scale theft and looting at VBS bank – as far back as early 2017 while still Deputy President of South Africa – cannot remain untested. Almost R2 billion was stolen from the accounts of hundreds of poor, vulnerable and elderly people who bank with VBS. This act of corruption was committed by rich politicians, politically connected businesspersons, and their associates – many of whom are either elected ANC officials, or have strong links to the ruling party. The President owes South Africa a full, honest account of his knowledge, and what action he subsequently took. I have received written confirmation from the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Lechesa Tsenoli, indicating that my urgent oral question to the President on this matter will be added to Order Paper for 6 November, in terms of Rule 141 of the National Assembly Rules. President Ramaphosa cannot duck and dive any longer. When he appears in Parliament to answer oral questions on 6 November, he will need to provide South Africa with a clear answer to the following question: On what date did he first become aware of the involvement of executives in corruption and looting at VBS Bank, and what date did he subsequently act in this regard? President Ramaphosa has to date failed to tell the nation the date on which he first became aware of the corruption and looting at VBS, and the date of when he first acted on this knowledge. It is absolutely vital to ascertain this, as the President has a legal duty to report corrupt transactions in terms of section 34(1) of Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act 12 of 2004 (PACCA). If he failed to do so, he may well be criminally liable. I look forward to engaging the President on this matter in Parliament.

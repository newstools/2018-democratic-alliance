Today, 15 October 2018, the Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Premier Candidate, Solly Msimanga Cllr, the DA Spokesperson on Immigration, Jacques Julius MP, and the DA Campaign Spokesperson, Solly Malatsi MP, will unveil the Partyâ€™s plan to tackle illegal immigration; fix the dysfunctional Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and ultimately secure our borders. Under 24 years of ANC government; our borders are not secure, the SANDF does not have the human or technical resources it needs to patrol our borders and we have a shambolic Department of Home Affairs which is riddled with corruption and incapable of addressing the monumental challenges facing the country. This lack of leadership by the ANC has created a breeding ground for illegal immigration which has led to an environment of mistrust and hostility between our citizens and foreign nationals who are here legally. This is not the South Africa it should be. The ANC is incapable of addressing the challenges of immigration in our country. The DA has a plan to ensure we secure our borders and fix the Department of Home Affairs. Our plan will bring law and order and protect the interests of those who are in our country legally. Details of the briefing are as follows: Date: 15 October 2018 Time: 10:00 Venue: Nkululeko House, 21 Ernest Oppenheimer Street, Bruma, Johannesburg

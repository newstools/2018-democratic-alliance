We note a number of media reports related to a City of Cape Town Council appointed independent investigation, which according to these media reports recommends that criminal charges be laid against Patricia de Lille amongst others, for interfering in City tenders and the legal duties and obligations of the former City Manager, Achmat Ebrahim, in instituting legally required disciplinary actions against officials guilty of violating the law. We, as the DA, have always maintained that this wholly independent investigation should be allowed to run its course so that the full extent of the governance breakdown in Cape Town under de Lille could be independently and fully investigated. It is important for the public to understand that there are two investigative reports, both which by all accounts point to continuous interference and misconduct by Patricia de Lille. The second more substantive report, which by all accounts includes 2000 pages of detailed evidence, based on interviews, legal submissions and other inputs paints a grim picture of Patricia de Lille’s conduct as Mayor. We await and respect the outcome of Thursday’s Council meeting where the results of this independent investigation are tabled. We would be hopeful that Ms de Lille and her associates do not seek to confuse the public any further on this matter.

The DA challenges the EFF to set the record straight and publicly confirm whether or not it has ever received money from VBS Mutual bank to fund its operations. The EFF has not been shy in their repeated and public defence of VBS Mutual Bank. Reports today, which reveal the extent of the looting and corruption at the bank, show that the brother of EFF deputy president, Floyd Shivambu, Brian received a massive R16 million from VBS. For the EFF, which parades itself as quasi-revolutionaries championing the plight of poor communities, to be intimately linked to individuals who shamelessly stole from the poor, affirms that their political posturing towards VBS may be rooted in protecting the personal interests of their leaders. Confirming if they did receive funds or not should be a simple exercise that can be settled instantly. Many hard-working South Africans almost lost their life savings and were forced to wait in long lines, often overnight, just to make sure they could get their money out. A total of 15 municipalities may never see the R1.5 billion they deposited with the bank and will not be able to deliver services to their residents. The DA will lay criminal charges against those who have been named in the South African Reserve Bank report including the likes of Brian Shivambu who need to be held accountable for theft. In July this year, we challenged the EFF to confirm whether they had received funds from VBS and no answer has been forthcoming. The EFF has an opportunity to simply confirm if they have or have not accepted money from VBS and should do so as soon as possible.

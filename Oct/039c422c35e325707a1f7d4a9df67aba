The DA mourns the passing of SA music legend, Jabulani Hip Hop Pantsula Tsambo. HHP was one of the fiercest pioneers of Mzansi hip hop and rapping in vernacular. From hits such as Harambe to Bosso Ke Mang he was an artist who used his voice to fight injustice, celebrate our diversity as a nation and provided the soundtrack of hope to millions of young people in our country. His passing will leave an irreparable vacuum but his music will live on. Rest in peace.

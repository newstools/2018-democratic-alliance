The Democratic Alliance calls on Parliament to make public the terms of reference of its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of parliamentary staffer, Lennox Garane, as well as the names of the individuals tasked with conducting the investigation. A fully transparent process is crucial to giving the grieving family the closure they deserve. The DA is in possession of a document Garane sent to the co-chairpersons of the Joint Standing Committee of Financial Management of Parliament, Vincent Smith and Motalane Monakedi, on 26 June 2018. This desperate cry for help was never shared with members of the Committee. The document details how Garane raised his concerns about his working conditions, but to no avail. We are left with more questions than answers, and a truly independent and transparent investigation is required. The only way to honour Garaneâ€™s memory is to ensure that the institutional failures at Parliament are acknowledged and addressed decisively.

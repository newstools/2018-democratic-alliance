Please find attached a soundbite in English by DA Shadow Minister of Communications, Phumzile Van Damme MP. Today, Parliament’s Portfolio Committee of Communications was unanimous in a decision that the notorious Broadcasting Amendment Bill must be sent back to the Ministry. The Bill, introduced by the then Minister of Communications, Faith Muthambi, sought to remove Parliament’s role in the appointment of the SABC’s non-executive board members and vest it in the Minister of Communications. The Bill also aimed to reduce the number of the non-executive board members from 12 to 9; reduce the quorum from 9 to 7. The DA welcomes this decision, and has since its introduction maintained it would see the last vestige of independence removed from the SABC, paving the way for it to become a ANC-government propaganda tool. We trust that the current Minister of Communications, Nomvula Mokonyane, will carefully consider the Bill, and re-table one that seeks to strengthen, not weaken the SABC’s independence.

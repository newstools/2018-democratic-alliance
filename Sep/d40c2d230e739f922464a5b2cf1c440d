The Democratic Alliance is saddened by the news of the passing of Minister Edna Molewa. We send our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends, as well as to the African National Congress. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. During her tenure as Minister of Environmental Affairs, the Minister did great work raising awareness around the scourge of Rhino poaching. On this day, World Rhino Day, we honour her commitment to this noble cause. May her soul Rest In Peace.

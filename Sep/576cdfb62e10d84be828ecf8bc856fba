Note to Editors: Today the Democratic Alliance Youth Leader, Luyolo Mphithi, accompanied young Western Cape voters to the IEC office in Athlone, Cape Town. His key message was that “young South Africans have the power to build one South Africa that puts the people first. Young people have an opportunity to have their voices heard in 2019”. Mphithi went on to state that “young people do not need to wait for another registration weekend, they just need their ID book or card and find their nearest IEC office”.

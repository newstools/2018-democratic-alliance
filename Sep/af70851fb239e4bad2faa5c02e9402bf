Barely a week after usurping power in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMBM), the ANC-led coalition of corruption and its puppet mayor, Mongameli Bobani, have made it clear that they plan to milk the City dry. Bobani and his fake mayoral committee have already given orders to halt tenders and have started to interfere in the appointment of municipal staff. Their focus is on removing the Municipal Manager, Johann Mettler, in order to boost their illegal activities and rob the people of the Bay. The Democratic Alliance (DA) will not attend tomorrow’s council meeting, as it is an illegal sitting called by an illegitimate Speaker. At the previous council meeting, after interference by Fikile Xasa, EC MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the illegal sitting was full of irregularities. The election of a new Speaker, the passing of a Motion of No Confidence in the Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, the election of a new Executive Mayor and the election of a Deputy Executive Mayor, were all illegal and invalid. The EFF, UDM and smaller parties have actively handed Nelson Mandela Bay back to the very ANC thieves who had previously brought the City to its knees. The legitimate NMB coalition government filed high court papers requesting a review of what we believe to have been a set of illegal decisions. Bobani’s statement, in which he calls the NMB coalition’s case “wishy-washy”, shows his ignorance of legal matters. We are more than confident that we will prevail when the PE High Court hears the application on 13 September. We will make a victorious return to City Hall. Athol Trollip is the real Executive Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. It is under Mayor Trollip’s Leadership that this Metro has started to see change. Only the coalition government led by Mayor Trollip can take Nelson Mandela Bay forward.

Two Democratic Alliance (DA) Ward Councillors, Trevor Louw and Neville Higgins, today made clear their willingness to defy the will of the people and hand Nelson Mandela Bay back to the ANC-led coalition of corruption. This, after they decided to side with the ANC and to take part in an illegal council meeting called by an illegitimate Speaker. It is not clear what inducement was offered to these misguided councillors, but they decided to betray the residents of the City, who came out in their numbers in 2016 and voted the ANC out of power. Louw handed in his resignation from the DA and procedures have been instituted to immediately terminate Higgins’s membership. It boggles the mind that these councillors see fit to side with the ANC after a high ranking ANC leader allegedly referred to coloured citizens in Cape Town as dogs. The chairperson of the ANC in the Western Cape, Khaya Magaxa, recently made this alleged reference to coloured people and this proves the ANC remains a racist and divisive organisation. It must be underlined that any decisions taken at today’s illegal council meeting will be declared null and void after the legitimate NMB coalition government next week emerges victorious in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The previous council meeting, on 27 August 2018, was illegal, after Fikile Xasa, EC MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, interfered in proceedings. The election of a new Speaker, the passing of a Motion of No Confidence in the Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, the election of a new Executive Mayor and the election of a Deputy Executive Mayor, were all illegal and invalid. The legitimate NMB coalition government filed high court papers requesting a review of what we believe to have been a set of illegal decisions. We are confident that the NMB coalition government, under the leadership of Mayor Trollip, will be back in City Hall after we are successful in our application on the 13th of September.

On behalf of the Democratic Alliance, I would like to wish all Jewish South Africans a happyÂ Rosh Hashanah. May this time of reflection and new beginnings be a blessed one. The Jewish New Year is a time to recommit to the ideals of kindness, to make a positive impact on the lives of others and for looking ahead to the new year. The DA extends our wishes that the new year brings many blessings of goodness, health and joy to the Jewish community. Shanah Tovah.

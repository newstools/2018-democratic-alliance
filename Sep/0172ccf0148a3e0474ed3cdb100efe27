The DA welcomes Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete’s, approval of our request to urgently debate plans to revive the economy following this week’s confirmation that South Africa is officially in recession. The Speaker has confirmed that Parliament will debate the economic recession next week. This is the second recession to hit the economy in two years with second quarter growth down 0.7% on the back of a 2.6% first quarter contraction. The recession is a vote of no confidence in the ANC government, its economic policy trajectory and ability to create jobs and opportunity for all South Africans. We are in this recession, with 9.6 million unemployed South Africans, because President Ramaphosa is more dedicated to shoring up his political support in the ANC than sorting out the economics in South Africa. President Ramaphosa’s political consolidation comes at the cost of the country’s economy. But while President Ramaphosa’s ANC may not have a plan to turn around this sinking ship, the DA have long been calling for a reform agenda which if executed, can turn around the economy. The DA’s agenda for reform that will be presented in Parliament on Monday will include implementable ideas to reverse the persistent economic decline, ignite growth and create jobs. I look forward to the Speaker’s confirmation of the date of next week’s debate.

As the Democratic Alliance we note the judgment handed down in the Port Elizabeth High Court. We respect the outcome and decision of the court. Today is a dark day for Nelson Mandela Bay and its people who are now led by a coalition of the corrupt. The UDM and EFF handed the City back to the failing ANC, which has no interest in the people. The ANC is only interested in maximum looting and minimum delivery and not putting the people of NMB first. The UDM and EFF put their political interests first and care nothing for the well-being of the people of NMB. In 2017 we said we cannot work with the UDM and we cannot work with Cllr Mongameli Bobani. We were prepared then to go into a minority government, because we were not prepared to compromise our principles. In 2016 the voters of NMB removed the corrupt and failing ANC from office and placed their trust in the DA. We will now fight from the opposition benches and hold this government to account. From the opposition benches we will ensure that corruption is stopped, access to jobs is opened and services are delivered. Only the DA can make sure that we keep making progress in Nelson Mandela Bay.

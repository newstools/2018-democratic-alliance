The Democratic Alliance (DA) is shocked by the violent assault on the Executive Mayor of Midvaal, Bongani Baloyi by ANC members this morning. Mayor Baloyi has immediately opened a case of assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm against the ANC thugs. However, when the Mayor was on his way to open a case at the police station, the key suspect followed him and lied to the police that the Mayor attacked him. Absurdly, the Mayor was also placed under arrest along with the suspect. The Mayor was physically attacked by ANC members in ward 11, Savannah City during the municipalityâ€™s launch of Arbor Day. The event started peacefully, however when the Mayor was about to go to the podium to address the community, ANC members approached him and tried to take the microphone away from him. They physically pushed the Mayor and hit him with a rock. This is totally unacceptable, as an attack on the Mayor is the attack on the residents of Midvaal. It is also an attack on democracy. The failed ANC has become desperate and its members are resorting to thuggery and other subversive behaviour in an attempt to retain power. Midvaal is one of the best governed municipalities in Gauteng and has received clean audits since DA took over this municipality from the ANC. We will not allow ANC to disrupt service delivery to the people of Midvaal. The DA is committed to continue delivering quality services, and to be transparent and accountable to Midvaal residents.

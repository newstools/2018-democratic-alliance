The DA calls on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to investigate the claims of assault laid against ANC Member of Parliament, Mduduzi Manana, by his former domestic worker, Christine Wiro. The suggestion that the SAPS will no longer investigate the claim because the complainant has “withdrawn” it, is both disingenuous and contrary to the law. The SAPS must ensure that the claims against Manana are thoroughly investigated and that he be charged if found to have acted unlawfully. Crucially, the police must also investigate reports that Ms Wiro was threatened, intimidated and subsequently offered R100,000 to withdraw the complaint. The DA will add these fresh allegations against Manana to our complaint to Parliament’s Ethics Committee. The DA also takes note of Manana’s stated intention to “file a legal suit against the Wiro family” and sees this as potentially another bullying tactic by the disgraced former Deputy Minister of Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training. Manana, a person of wealth and influence, previously avoided serving 12 months in jail by paying a R100,000 fine after being convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily in September 2017. He should not be allowed to escape the consequences of his alleged actions through coercion or bribery. We now call on the ANC to do what they should have done eight months ago and remove Manana as a Member of Parliament. If the ANC truly cares about the rights of women, they will act speedily and decisively. Manana does not belong in Parliament earning a salary paid by taxpayers, and the fact that he continues to serve as an MP proves the ANC is not committed to building a non-sexist society and ending the scourge of violence against women.

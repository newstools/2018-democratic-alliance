The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West has lodged a Promotion of Access to Information Act of 2000 (PAIA) application to the ensure we get access to the Inter-Ministerial Task Team’s (IMTT) report on the state of affairs in North West. South Africans have the right to the content of the report by the IMTT, headed by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, which was presented to Cabinet this week. The ANC has dragged its feet for long enough now, it is therefore vital that South Africans are made aware of the ANC government’s assessment the collapse of the North West.  We will not allow them to further put a lid on the real problems the people face – corruption, looting, mismanagement and a lack of political will by the ANC to act against cadres. The time for covering up is over for the ANC and President Cyril Ramaphosa. This investigation was instigated by President Ramaphosa who appointed the task team to give urgent attention to matters of governance and risks facing the North West province. The team visited the Province more than two weeks ago. We suspect that the IMTT was another PR stunt by Ramaphosa, who has been missing in action since he rushed back from the UK. When real action is needed Ramaphosa is no where to be found. Real change will only come to the North West when the people use their voting might to vote out liars and looters, and vote for total change under a DA-led government that always puts the people first.

The City of Johannesburg recently proposed that at least 20% in all residential developments over ten units be set aside for inclusionary housing. The draft policy is designed to provide rental housing at affordable prices for low income earners. It provides that inclusionary units have to be on the same site as the development. These units would be available to residents with a total monthly household income of not more than R7 000 and the rent plus levies may not exceed R2 100 per month or 30% of the household income. This kind of innovative policy would be a step in the right direction for inclusionary housing in South Africa, particularly in city centres, where housing is often over-priced and unattainable for low to medium income earners.

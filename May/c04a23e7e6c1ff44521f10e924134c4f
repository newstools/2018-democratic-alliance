The DA condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack at the Imam Hussain Mosque in Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal this afternoon. Three men, believed to be Egyptian nationals, allegedly stormed the mosque this afternoon, slitting the throats of three people and setting parts of the mosque alight. One of the victims have reportedly succumbed to his injuries whilst two are in a critical condition. The DA sends our condolences to the family of the deceased and hope that the two victims, currently fighting for their lives, will make a full recovery. The DA calls on the SAPS to find the criminals responsible for this atrocious act and bring them to book. We also call for a speedy investigation in order to get to the bottom of this attack. Such heinous attacks at places of worship have no place in a democratic society.

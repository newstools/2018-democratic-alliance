The DA would like to extend warm Eid Mubarak wishes to all Muslims across South Africa. For the next few days, the Muslim community will celebrate Eid al-Fitr. The breaking of fast festival, marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. A time of spiritual reflection and good will in the Muslim community. Recent tragic incidences have caused much trauma for the Muslim community in South Africa. We extend our condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives and assureÂ the community that the DA stands in solidarity with them. We trust that this Eid will be a time of joy, gratitude and thanksgiving with family and friends. Eid Mubarak to all our Muslim brothers and sisters!

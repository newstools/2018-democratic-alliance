The DA welcomes the decision by the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs to institute a full-scale parliamentary inquiry into the Gupta family’s citizenship. This decision follows a letter the DA wrote to the Chairperson of the Committee requesting an investigation into the controversy surrounding the naturalisation of the Gupta Family. In our letter to the Chairperson, the DA revealed that several more members of the Gupta Family were granted citizenship. This information was never revealed or reported to Parliament, as is required by law. In addition to this, Minister Malusi Gigaba and his department only explained the circumstances surrounding the naturalisation of 5 Gupta family members, when there was in fact a further 6 members of the Gupta family that are South African citizens and registered as voters on the IEC database. On 15 June, the House Chairperson of Committees, Mr Cedric Frolick, instructed Chairpersons of the certain Portfolio Committees to institute State Capture inquiries. However, frustrated attempts by opposition parties to get to the ball rolling on an inquiry were continuously frustrated by the former Chairperson of Portfolio Committee Mr Mashile. Under Mashile, the committee undertook a superficial probe into the naturalisation of Mr Ajay Gupta and four other members of his immediate. A probe, which Minister Gigaba only appeared after continuously evading opportunities to testify. This time around the DA will ensure the Minister and the Guptas have no opportunity to dodge accounting to Parliament. We look forward to this inquiry and to  ensure that those found guilty of any corruption will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law

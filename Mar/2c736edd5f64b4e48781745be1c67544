The DA informed and forwarded the report on serious allegations to the Minister of Defence & Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and the Secretary of Defence, Dr Sam Gulube, to urgently call for a full forensic investigation into the board of the Castle of the Good Hope in Cape Town following allegations of extensive corruption. These allegations came to my attention and I compiled a report that can be accessedÂ here. It is disheartening that such a historical monument, has been possibly plagued by corruption due to gross mismanagement as its highest levels. A range of serious allegations have been made concerning the facility including: This historic entity falls directly under the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans and Minister Mapisa-Nqakula should ensure a thorough investigation is conducted and those implicated are held accountable. To this end, the DA has provided the Portfolio Committee with the dossier and will demand a full forensic audit of the heritage site. The DA will not sit idly by while the Department of Defence & Military Veterans allows our monuments to descend into ruins due to possible corruption.

For years the people of Slovo Park Informal Settlement have knocked on government’s door, seeking help; asking for government to bring light to their community. Instead, they were forced to accept an empty slogan of a so-called World class African City when for many of them that was but a distant dream. The previous ANC administration was happy to spend R340 million on a new state of the art council chamber when it could not electrify informal settlements, issue title deeds, or lift a finger to combat the rampant drug abuse in our communities. From the beginning of its term, the DA-led administration embarked on a project to cut wasteful expenditure that resulted in a saving of close to R500 million by cutting spending, self-promoting advertising, marketing and unnecessary international trips. These savings will be redirected into critical service delivery areas such as maintenance of traffic lights and street lights, repairing potholes, upgrading informal settlement such as this one and making sure key City departments are able to deliver quality services to all our residents. The City has allocated R50 million to electrify Slovo Park, which involves upgrading the Nancefield substation as a source of power supply in the area. With this project, the DA-led administration will help the residents of Slovo Park to begin to put behind years of suffering. Click here to read the full statement.

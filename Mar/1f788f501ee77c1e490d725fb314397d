The DA’s Private Member’s Bill (PMB), to amend The South African National Roads Agency Limited and National Roads (SANRAL) Act, is scheduled to be discussed in the Transport Portfolio Committee on Tuesday, 13 March, after it was tabled in Parliament on 18 August 2017. The Bill will make provisions for the public, provincial legislatures and local councils to be reasonably consulted and afforded an opportunity to give their inputs regarding proposed toll roads. This PMB will also facilitate democratic involvement “by requiring a majority vote in favour of the proposed declaration in the relevant provincial legislature”. The PMB also proposes the construction and maintenance of alternative roads for those who cannot afford to pay toll fees. At the heart of the Bill is the need to prevent another e-Tolls fiasco, as seen in Gauteng, which cost billions of rands and went ahead without any meaningful input from the public and relevant stakeholders. The DA is of the belief that the PMB will go a long way in ensuring that, in future, the decision to establish toll roads will be an open and transparent process, and not a closed and autonomous decision taken solely by SANRAL. E-tolls in Gauteng is a complete disaster, and this is due to the lack of consultation from all stakeholders – which is what the PMB seeks to rectify. The DA strongly opposed the ill-conceived e-tolls from the onset, which have excluded the poor from opportunities and have become a financial burden on hardworking residents. Through our PMB we will ensure that public infrastructure work to the benefit of our people, and not to exclude them.

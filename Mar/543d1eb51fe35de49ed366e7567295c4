The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to thank the people of Ward 1 in Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) for their remarkable support in yesterday’s by-election. The people of NMB have clearly illustrated that they want the DA-led multiparty and Mayor Athol Trollip to continue with its programme of bringing Total Change to the Metro through job creation, service delivery and the elimination of corruption. In 2016, the DA won Ward 1 with an 85% majority; that majority has now crescendoed to 92%. Those who are working actively to divide NMB on the basis of race and hand back the metro to liars and looters do not believe in the democratic will of the people. It is clear that the motion of no confidence against the coalition and Mayor Trollip serves to reverse the progress made since 2016 and create an environment where corruption thrives. Since taking office, the DA-led coalition has made significant progress. Some of the highlights include: • The elimination of bucket toilets
• Filling vacancies in order to improve service delivery
• The establishment of a Metro Police Department
• An internship programme in the Mayor’s Office for young people
• Accelerated title deed handover programme The DA and its coalition partners in the Bay will continue working around the clock to positively change the lives of the people.

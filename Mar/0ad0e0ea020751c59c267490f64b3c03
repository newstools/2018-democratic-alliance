Parliament’s Public Enterprises Committee, in a closed meeting today, have resolved to launch an application for an edictal citation with the High Court in order to force the Gupta brothers, Dudu Myeni and Duduzane Zuma to testify before the Eskom Inquiry. The DA welcomes this decision by the Committee. It makes it clear that we will not condone the blatant disregard shown for Parliament’s authority. Following numerous attempts by Parliament’s legal team to serve the Guptas, Myeni and Zuma with their summonses, they have used every trick in the book to evade accountability. The Guptas, who are suspected to be outside of the borders of the Republic, have failed to provide the Inquiry with information on their whereabouts, leaving the Committee with no other choice but to approach the Court. Myeni has also frustrated attempts efforts to serve her with a summons, by refusing to reveal her residential address. However, the Committee has the ID numbers of both Myeni and Duduzane Zuma and we will now proceed to inform the Courts that both are registered to vote and their residential addresses can, therefore, be requested from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). Myeni is registered to vote at the AGS Lewende Waters in Richards Bay and Duduzane Zuma is registered to vote at the Saxonwold Primary School in Johannesburg. The Gupta brothers, Myeni and Duduzane Zuma are currently scheduled to testify before the Committee on 11 April 2018. Should they fail to show up, the Committee will push for warrants of arrest to be issued. The Public Enterprises Committee has once again proven that it will not back down on getting to the bottom of State Capture. The DA will continue to work with our colleagues across the political spectrum to ensure that all those responsible for State Capture are brought to book.

On Wednesday, 28 March, the Departments of Health (DoH); Trade and Industry (DTI) and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) will brief Parliament in a joint sitting on the Listeriosis crisis, following a request by the DA. This meeting follows an announcement by Health Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, earlier this month that traces of the Listeria bacterium have been identified at Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken factories. Despite the traces of Listeria at Enterprise and Rainbow facilities, we still cannot be certain of the primary source of this outbreak. To date, more 180 people have sadly lost their lives. It is clear that the Department of Health cannot fight this outbreak on its own and we require a multi-industry approach to prevent a further loss of life. The three departments must use this joint sitting to address the following concerns: For the past few months, the DA has been engaging with experts across the Health, Trade and Agriculture industries who have raised concerns regarding the governmentâ€™s reaction to this outbreak and the implications of this outbreak on food and job security. The DA awaits this joint meeting and we trust that the relevant departments will brief Parliament on the collective work done to combat this outbreak effectively and what plans have been put in place to ensure that we do not have a repeat of this outbreak again.

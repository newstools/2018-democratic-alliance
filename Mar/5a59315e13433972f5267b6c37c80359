The news of an urgent meeting called by the African National Congress (ANC) to discuss the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) coalition offer reveals the panic of an organisation that has lost its way. The motion of no confidence tabled by the EFF against our Mayor, Athol Trollip, followed by this urgent meeting is the clearest sign yet that it is the EFF calling the shots while the ANC bows to the pressure of this 6% party. When the EFF shouts, the ANC jumps. The Ndebele Report on the status of the ANC Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) further reveals the extent of internal dysfunction within the provincial governing party – it is no wonder that they are so desperate to please the EFF. The systematic looting of the Municipality’s coffers at the hands of the corrupt ANC brought the city to its knees and as a result the voters of NMB removed the ANC from office and voted for a DA-led coalition government, ushering in a new beginning for the people of the city. Since 3 August 2016, the DA-led coalition government has: We together with our coalition partners in NMB have worked so hard to bring about much needed stability to the municipality. For corruption to flourish, one has to create chaos and uncertainty, and the frivolous motion of no confidence by the EFF seeks to achieve just that. The DA will not sit back and allow the EFF to return the City to the ANC so they can continue where they left off. A populist partnership between these two parties will spell disaster for NMB.

The DA-led City of Tshwane has made available R226 325 to settle outstanding fees for the 2017 academic year for ten existing beneficiaries. The Msimanga administration is also at the advanced stages of revising the Informal Trader’s Bursary Fund framework. Following a number of meetings with relevant departments with the necessary information regarding this matter, it was agreed that the Fund must, as a matter of principle, be integrated into a broader City of Tshwane Bursary Scheme which is under the control of the Department of Corporate and Shared Services. This will ensure the fund is handled by officials with necessary knowledge and expertise in this regard. Research shows that the informal trading sector contributes to the creation of jobs and alleviation of poverty, and if nothing gets done about improving the educational situation of informal traders’ dependents, they too are likely to end up becoming informal traders with no passion for the sector but as a means of survival. Therefore, this initiative makes it even more important that the City administers the scheme properly and ensures the right people get the assistance they need. You can read the full statement here

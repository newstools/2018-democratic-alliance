Today the DA marched with the residents of Jagersfontein to hand over a list of grievances to the Kopanong Municipality. This community has been without water for the past three years because of mismanagement by an uncaring ANC. It is a gross human rights violation for people to live without water this long. The DA will request the Water and Sanitation Portfolio Committee, to summon the Kopanong Municipality’s Mayor, Xolile Matwa, and Municipal Manager, Mr. M. Kubeka, to appear before the committee and account for the plight faced by Jagersfontein residents. The DA has previously held meetings with the residents to ascertain their grievances, it is after meeting with them that the DA wrote to the South African Human Rights Commission to lodge an official complaint against the municipality’s inability to supply people with water. After assessing the Auditor-General’s report it became clear that the source of these people’s plight is financial mismanagement. The municipality owes more than it is owed. The DA wrote to the FS Cogta MEC, Oupa Khoabane requesting him to put the municipality under administration. These are some of the steps taken by the DA to ensure that the forgotten people of Jagersfontein get to be remembered. Requesting the Mayor and the Municipal Manager to be summoned and appear before the committee is one of the steps that the DA will take in ensuring that the residents of Kopanong do not have to go through such inhumane treatment by this ANC run municipality. The DA is committed to bringing about the real change that will bring dignity to the people and deliver quality services.

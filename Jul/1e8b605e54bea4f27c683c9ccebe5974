Pictures from the event are attached here, here and here. Today, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Nomsa Marchesi MP, DA Member of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education, Sonja Boshoff MP, Executive Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality and DA Federal Chairperson, Athol Trollip, and DA Shadow MEC for Education in the Eastern Cape, Edmund van Vuuren MPL, attended the first of a series of hearings on whether a minimum service level should be declared for school staff. DA leaders Sonja Boshoff MP and Edmund van Vuuren MPL both made verbal submissions to the Essential Services Committee (ESC), calling for a minimum staff presence at schools to ensure children are safe during strikes and union meetings. We trust that the ESC will favourably consider the submissions made by the DA today. DA leaders will travel across the country in coming weeks, making further submissions to the ESC. Our call for a minimum service level is not intended to stop teachers from striking. However, we firmly believe that learners are entitled to care and protection during school hours. Our request to the ESC on setting a minimum service level is based on three main concerns: It is unfair to keep placing the responsibility of ensuring learner safety on children themselves. Schools should be centres of safety and excellence and abandoning children when there is a strike does not allow for this. Children need quality education so they have the best chance of finding work, which is already difficult given the fact that 9.5 million South Africans are unemployed. A safe environment is vital for learning, but this will be hard to achieve when school staff members leave children to fend for themselves to go on strike or attend union meetings. This is why the DA has asked the ESC to look into setting a minimum service level for school staff.

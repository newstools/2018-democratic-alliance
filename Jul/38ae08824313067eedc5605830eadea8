The DA notes with concern the increased number in reports of violence at schools. These reports paint a grim picture of how schools have become unsafe spaces for South African learners. Just this week a video circulated on Twitter of a male teacher hitting a female pupil in class. There have also been a number of videos showing teachers and pupils in physical altercations. Earlier this year at Eldorado Park Secondary. Two pupils got into a fight and one was stabbed. The fight occurred at the time SADTU teachers were on strike and there wasn’t anyone to supervise the class. This is exactly the situation we are concerned about. The DA has repeatedly called on the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to support our  #SafeSchools campaign in order to curb violence at schools. This week, the DA will continue its fight to make schools safer for learners, teachers and school staff, as we will be making our submissions at the Essential Services Committee (ESC) public hearings which start on Wednesday, 11 July 2018. In April, the DA submitted an application to the ESC to declare that there should be a minimum staff presence at schools during education strikes. This all forms part of the DA’s initiative to ensure that children are kept safe and supervised during strike action. It is time for the ANC government to prioritise safety at schools. Our children deserve access to an educational environment that is free from violence and conducive to them reaching their full potential.

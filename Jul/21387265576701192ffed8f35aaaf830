The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gaunteng welcomes the determined action by Joburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPPD) in tracking down and arresting suspects involved in a cash in transit (CIT) heist. The heist took place in Dobsonville, Soweto, earlier this month. In a climate where incidents of CIT are on the rise in our province, DA Mayor Mashaba today confirmed that one of the four suspects was reportedly an employee of the ANC, based at Luthuli house at the time of arrest. It is of serious concern that the ANC has been silent on this matter, as they have been on other matters relating to criminality in their own ranks. With suspected and convicted criminal elements within its ranks, it is clear that the ANC cannot be trusted with keeping our people safe and bring order to our communities. We have yet to see the ANC so much as condemn, let alone act against Brian Hlongwa following the R1.2 billion corruption scandal he has been implicated in. The ANC has rather moved him from his position of MEC of Health in Gauteng, to the Chief Whip in the Legislature. It is time that the ANC comes out to condemn, as well as act against those who among its ranks who are involved in criminality. South Africa is in a state of lawlessness and disorder. It is the duty of the ANC-run National Government to ensure that criminals are brought to book swiftly. They have failed to do so. Instead, they mollycoddle corruption within their own organisation. We need change that brings order and builds one South Africa for all, where people are free to live their lives in a safe society. The DA-led City of Joburg is making strides in that direction by cracking down on criminals.

As the world observes the 30th annual World AIDS Day, the Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to call on all South Africans to take a moment to remember all of the countless South Africans who have sadly lost their lives in the fight against this epidemic. To all those living with HIV/AIDS, we commend your courage and bravery and trust that you will continue to fight for your good health and the rights of those living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 7.5 million South Africans live with HIV. Of this group, 19% are people aged 15 to 49. Despite having the largest antiretroviral treatment programme in the world, HIV/AIDS continue to have a devastating impact on South Africaâ€™s youth. Young people are the lifeblood and future of this country and we should do much more in ensuring that our future is healthy and vibrant. This statistic paints a grim picture of how little we have accomplished in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Organisations such as the South African National AIDS Council (SANAC), which is chaired by Deputy President DD Mabuza, play a vital role in addressing the progress of HIV/AIDS alleviation in South Africa. As a society, we also have a collective responsibility to fight for better HIV awareness and treatment in our country. We need to build a South Africa where HIV/AIDS is not a death sentence or a shame. On this World AIDS Day, the DA commits itself to build One South Africa for All, where those living with HIV/AIDS have access to dignified medical treatment and live free and full lives.

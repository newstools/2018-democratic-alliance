The latest employment figures promises a bleak Christmas for 16 000 South African families, and confirms that the failing ANC has no plan for our economy. The latest employment figures released today by Stats SA show that the economy has shed another 16 000 jobs in the third quarter of 2018, this on the back of shedding 69 000 jobs in the second quarter. This means that in 6 months, South Africa has lost 85 000 jobs. The manufacturing sector lost 7000 jobs, construction lost 5000 jobs, mining and quarrying lost 2000 jobs, 1000 transport jobs were lost, and a further 1000 jobs were lost in the field of community service. Far from delivering on the promise of a growing, job creating economy, the ANC is causing more damage to the economy through disastrous economic mismanagement. In contrast, DA governments are responsible for 50% of all new jobs in South Africa this year, despite only constituting 12% of the labour market. That is because we have a clear plan to grow the economy, and a clear track record of doing so in government. The failing ANC has become complicit with no plan to get the economy growing and with no plan to create jobs that South Africans can access. The DA is the only party serious about building a modern, successful economy that opens access to real, long-term jobs. The DA is bringing change that builds One South Africa for All.

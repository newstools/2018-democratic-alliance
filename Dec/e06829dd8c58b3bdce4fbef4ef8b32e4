The Democratic Alliance (DA) congratulates the young and charismatic Executive Mayor of the Midvaal Municipality, Bongani Baloyi for achieving its fifth consecutive clean audit. The DA-governed Midvaal Municipality is the only municipality in Gauteng to hold onto its clean audit status, while the ANC-led municipalities failed in this regard. Midvaal has achieved clean audits for the following financial years; 2014/2015, 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. This indicates the sterling work done by the energetic Mayor, and the DA’s unwavering commitment to good governance, transparency and accountability. This municipality has the lowest unemployment rate in the province. Taxpayer’s money is used strictly for service delivery and not for personal gain. We will ensure that we implement the same strategies in 2019 when we govern this province. The DA is the only party that is committed to eliminating corruption, ensuring good governance and providing better services to Gauteng residents

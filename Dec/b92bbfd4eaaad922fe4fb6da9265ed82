The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply saddened by the passing of Alex Boraine. Boraine, who served as the Deputy Chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, played a central role during the critical years following the dawn of the new democratic dispensation. As the partyÂ founded on liberal ideals for which he fought, we are deeply saddened by the passing of one of the last remaining vanguards and indeed giants of liberal thought and ideals in our country. Boraine, was elected on the ticket of the Progressive Party as an MP in 1974, a party which fiercely opposed the brutal apartheid government. Boraine spoke truth to power at a time when it would have been more comfortable for him to remain silent. His passion for our country and bravery will live within our hearts and minds forever. The DA will always value his contribution to liberal values in South Africa and we will remain resolute in our efforts to keep his enduring passion for democratic freedoms alive. Rest in peace, Alex Boraine.

Today’s announcement of matric mark adjustments by Umalusi has again raised questions about the management of the  exams. Of the 67 subjects considered for the Department of Basic Education (DBE) matric exams, 17 had their marks adjusted upwards – one more than last year. This means a quarter of all DBE subjects still have their marks adjusted upwards. This continuing trend raises some serious questions. DBE NSC subject adjustments (2012-2018)  Unfortunately, we have no idea how large these adjustments are. Umalusi hides this information from the public, and refuses to allow elected Members of Parliament to attend the standardisation meeting. Anyone who questions these adjustments is accused of attempting to disrupt the process and attack the school system, simply for asking for clarity. Protecting the quality of the matric certificate is vital to ensuring that young South Africans can study further or secure a job after school. The DA will continue to seek greater transparency so that learners and their parents can feel secure in their matric qualification. The DA congratulates all learners who accepted the challenge of writing the exams, and wishes the matrics all the best for the announcement of the results next week.

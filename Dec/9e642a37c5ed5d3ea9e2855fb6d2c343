On behalf of the Democratic Alliance (DA), I would like to wish all South Africans a Merry Christmas. Christmas is a significant time of celebration in the Christian faith. It is a celebration of hope for a better world, and is a time of generosity, neighbourly love and family. I would like to wish all South Africans a time of peace and reflection. May this holiday be an opportunity to rest and look to the New Year for prosperity. As we come together to do good in our communities this festive season, let our thoughts be with those for whom Christmas may not be a time of celebration. Let us choose hope over fear as we continue to build One South Africa for All into the New Year.

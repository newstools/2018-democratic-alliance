The listed transaction cost schedule, and the unlisted transaction schedule, handed over by the Public Investment Corporation, can be found here and here. To his credit, the Chairperson of the Public Investment Corporation, Deputy Minister of Finance, Mondli Gungubele, has done an about turn and handed over a significant set of documents to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. The documents requested by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts handed over include: The unlisted investments holdings schedule includes, most importantly, the names of “Politically Exposed Persons”. The documents requested by myself via the Standing Committee on Public Accounts handed over include: However, the extracts of minutes of meetings have been marked “confidential” and have been handed over for “members only”. This follows “Mexican Standoff”: The fact that the documents have now been handed over is a major breakthrough and credit must go to Themba Godi, Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and members of the committee, who would not let the Public Investment Corporation off the hook in Parliament. The Public Investment Corporation appears before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts this evening at 18h00, in Committee Room V454, Fourth Floor, Old Assembly Building in Parliament.

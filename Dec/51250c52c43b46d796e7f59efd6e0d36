The by-election that took place in Ward 9 in Witzenberg yesterday shows promising growth for the DA. The by-election follows the resignation of the former ANC Councillor and saw the DA grow to 37.7%. This is a 4.4% increase from the 33.3% that we garnered in the 2016 local government elections. The ANC saw a meagre increase of 0.6% among voters in the ward, receiving 49.5% in the by-election after having received 48.9% in 2016. This shows that despite the challenges that we have faced in recent months, voters know that we are the only party that can take our country forward. We are committed to delivering to all South Africans and we are encouraged that voters believe in our record of good governance. We have consistently shown the people of this province that we will work for them and we will continue to do so. I want to thank those who cast their vote in favour of the DA yesterday, the Leadership of the DA West Region, our operational staff from the Provincial Head Office and most importantly, I want to thank our activists, who are the heartbeat of our party. Kom ons hou die Wes-Kaap blou in 2019.

The Presidency has confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa will be on a Working Visit to the European Union today and tomorrow. This, while the Deputy President, David Mabuza’s whereabouts are, as of yet, unknown. Deputy President Mabuza is reportedly in Russia on sick leave, leaving South Africa with no Executive Head in the absence of both the President and Vice-President. While the President’s duties are not being met, his Deputy’s Parliamentary duties remain abandoned too. The ANC government has literally left the country with no leadership and no time or effort was made to announce who will be acting in their absence. The DA calls on President Ramaphosa to announce an Acting President urgently. The fact that no announcement has been made, in the wake of the Deputy President going AWOL, raises questions on whether the country has been left in reliable hands. South African citizens deserve decisive leadership that is accountable and reliable – leadership which communicates with the public instead of leaving them in the dark. It would appear that both the President and his Deputy have forgotten about their Constitutional obligations and responsibilities. Ramaphosa and Mabuza must not forget that they are not accountable to themselves, but accountable to the public.

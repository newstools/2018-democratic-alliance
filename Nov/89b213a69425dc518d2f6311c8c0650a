Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by DA Team One SA Spokesperson on Women, Dr Nomafrench Mbombo. Pictures can be downloaded here and here.  Today, DA Team One SA Spokesperson on Women Dr Nomafrench Mbombo engaged with the community of Petrusville, in the Northern Cape where a 44-year-old blind woman was allegedly raped in a communal toilet. The women and children of Petrusville live under siege, and gender-based violence has become the order of the day in the community. The scourge of rape has been exacerbated by the lack of basic services. There are no street lights and, in some areas, people share one communal toilet. This has left vulnerable women and children at risk of falling victim to rape. The lack of proper policing in the area has also contributed to the high levels of gender-based violence. It is for this reason the DA handed over a memorandum to the Petrusville police to request that a dedicated police officer is dispatched to patrol the area. We also called on the local police authorities to strengthen sexual abuse prevention programmes in the community. Petrusville is one of many communities that has been neglected by the failing ANC government. With the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign having kicked off on Sunday, it is imperative that government takes greater action to combat this scourge not only during this period, but all year round. The DA is committed to creating an honest and professional police service, which keeps women and children safe. This is the kind of change that builds Ones South Africa for All.

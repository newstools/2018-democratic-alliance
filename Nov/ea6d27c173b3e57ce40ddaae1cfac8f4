The DA would like to extend warm Diwali wishes to all Hindu South Africans. The festival of lights is not only a time of celebration but also a time of reflection on the importance of family and friendship and how we need to work together to create a prosperous future for ourselves, our children and our communities. The DA wishes that every candle lit during Diwali bring joy, happiness and prosperity to every home. May this time remind us of the bonds we share and that it is our joint responsibility to strive for unity and prosperity for all South Africans. The DA trusts this festival of lights fill all homes with fresh hope, good health, new dreams and bright days ahead. As the DA, we are committed to building one South Africa for all where our diversity is always celebrated.

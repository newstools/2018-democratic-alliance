Note to Editors: Today, DA Leader Mmusi Maimane,  DA Spokesperson on State Capture, Natasha Mazzone MP, and DA Shadow Minister of Police, Zakhele Mbhele MP, submitted a supplementary affidavit on State Capture at the Cape Town Central police station. Please find attached an English soundbite by Ms Mazzone and an isiZulu soundbite by Mr Mbhele.  Earlier this month, National Treasury released three reports which detail explosive findings of State Capture at Transnet and Eskom which implicate the companies McKinsey and Trillian. The DA submitted these reports as supplementary evidence into the police’s investigations into State Capture and criminal cases already opened by the DA against several government officials. The DA has pursued every possible channel available to ensure that those who were implicated in State Capture are held accountable including parliamentary oversight, opening criminal cases, reporting to the Public Protector and advocating for the Eskom Inquiry. The DA also enquired about the state of investigations into State Capture. To date, we have laid the following 10 sets of charges against the following people or institutions: The police have a responsibility to probe those who have been implicated in looting the state and it is vital that they update South Africans on the charges in the interests of transparency. The DA will continue to fight to ensure that those implicated in State Capture are brought to book. Pictures can be downloaded here and here.

Please find attached soundbites in English and isiXhosa by DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, following a visit to African fin-tech company, Yoco, this afternoon. Today, Wednesday 14 November 2018, Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader, Mmusi Maimane, paid a visit to Yoco, an African fin-tech company at the cutting edge of helping small businesses and entrepreneurs establish themselves, become successful, and create new jobs. Founded only three years ago, the company’s innovative card payments solutions have radically simplified access to markets and operating costs of more than 30 000 small businesses and entrepreneurs throughout South Africa. “The greatest challenge that we face as a nation today is that there are too many South Africans without jobs and who remain locked out of the economy. South Africa is a country made up of economic ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders.’ Today, our nation’s new heroes are those who create work for the almost 10 million South Africans who do not have or have given up looking for jobs” said Maimane. He added that “It is by partnering with innovative businesses such as Yoco that DA-led Governments continue to lead the charge in job creation. Between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018, 50% of all new jobs were created in the DA-run Western Cape.” Maimane was joined by DA Western Cape Premier Candidate, Alan Winde, Western Cape MEC for Economic Opportunities, Beverley Schafer, DA Western Cape Deputy Leader, Albert Fritz, Team One SA Spokesperson on Access to Jobs, Geordin Hill-Lewis, and DA Cape Metro Chairperson, Grant Twigg.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision of the Constitutional Court to dismiss the appeal of Minister Malusi Gigaba against the finding that he lied under oath and thus violated the Constitution. This judgment comes just one day after the Public Protector recommended that president Cyril Ramaphosa take disciplinary action against the Minister for the same infraction. The judgment also removes any basis on which the Minister may hope to be vindicated and leaves no doubt that his conduct merits the harshest sanction. We must remember that this judgment stems from a judicial challenge to an attempt by Gigaba to dishonour a contractual agreement with Fireblade to the benefit of the Gupta family. The DA will now submit parliamentary questions to determine exactly how much this futile exercise by Gigaba will cost the taxpayer. The failure of the president to dismiss Gigaba will mark his definitive vote in favour of dishonesty and corruption. This is a watershed moment wherein the president’s ‘New Dawn’ is being put to the test. Our message to Ramaphosa is clear: fire Gigaba for the sake of all South Africans who have endured the scourge of corruption for too long and begin to put an end to the State Capture project once and for all.

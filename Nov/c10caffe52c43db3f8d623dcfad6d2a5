The Democratic Alliance is incensed by the creation of a surveillance squad dedicated to hunting down LGBTI people as announced by Dar es Salaam Govenor, Paul Makonda. Governor Makonda has stated that round-ups would begin next week. The plan is to use social media to track down and arrest people in same sex relationships in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Homosexual acts are illegal and punishable by law in Tanzania. This should be a call to action to people all over the world who share a belief in the values of dignity, freedom and equality for all. The injustice of the Tanzanian law is compounded by the increase in anti-gay rhetoric under the current administration. Last year the DA challenged the silence of the ANC government when South African human rights activists were arrested in Tanzania for their advocacy work in support of facilities providing health services to people particularly at risk of contracting HIV. The silence of the ANC government this time will be no less shameful. Minister Lindiwe Sisulu needs to immediately engage the Tanzanian government in an effort to stop this outrageous human rights atrocity before it begins. One day of cyberstalking or incarceration of the LGBTI community by the Tanzanian government will be one too many. We saw an anaemic reaction from the Department of International Relations in response to the news of the murder of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi. South Africa now has yet another opportunity to act with the courage of our convictions. We must take a stand for the protection of human rights on our continent. South Africa must take up the mantle of international moral leadership and act now to support the LGBTI community in Tanzania. Our Constitution and our values as a nation require nothing less.

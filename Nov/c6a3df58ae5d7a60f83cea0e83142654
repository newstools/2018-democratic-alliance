Note to Editors: Find attached a voiceclip from Joe McGluwa, DA North West Premier Candidate The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West has today laid criminal charges against former Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act and Section 6 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA) at the Mmabatho Police Station.    This follows strong allegations citing that he abused his position to facilitate the investment of people’s money with VBS bank, worth R314 million, from four municipalities namely, Madibeng, Moretele, Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati and Mahikeng. Section 6 of POCA states that “any person who (a) acquires; (b) uses; or (c) has possession of, property and who knows or ought reasonably to have known that it is or forms part of the proceeds of unlawful activities of another person, shall be guilty of an offence.” The looting of VBS will continue to negatively impact service delivery and the lives of those affected, especially people oppressed by poverty.  Many people nearly lost their life savings and the families of the bank’s retrenched employees who have lost a valuable source of income. The DA is the only party that has continuously fought for justice for those who have been affected by the looting of VBS and we are determined to ensure that the culprits are held accountable. The SAPS must now investigate these charges to ensure that those responsible for this terrible crime against the people face the full might of the law. The DA is committed to building One South Africa for All, free from corrupt politicians who abuse their positions for personal enrichment. You can download the pictures here, here, here and here.

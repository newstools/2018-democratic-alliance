Today the ANC confirmed that they did indeed receive an R2 million “donation” from VBS Mutual Bank. The party must now do the right thing and repay every cent it received from the bank. This revelation is an indictment on Minister Zweli Mkhize who allegedly requested the R2 million ‘donation’ from Vele Investments, in 2016 during his tenure as ANC treasurer-general, in return for his help in raising funds from municipalities and state institutions. The VBS heist has cost South Africans dearly, service delivery in the affected municipalities have already been either halted or delayed, and in some cases, government workers could not be paid. In July 2018 the DA wrote to the Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule, asking whether the ANC has indeed received money from this elaborate corruption and whether the ANC would pay back the money if they did receive any. The ANC refused to reply. It is clear that the ANC sought to mislead the public about the fact that they once again benefited from looting from the poor. The DA will not be deterred in our quest to hold all those who have been implicated in the VBS heist to account – irrespective of their political affiliations.

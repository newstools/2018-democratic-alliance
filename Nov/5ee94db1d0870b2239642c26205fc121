The Democratic Alliance has written to the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, to request an urgent meeting to discuss the progress of investigations into charges the DA has laid related to State Capture. South Africans deserve an update and transparency from the police on these investigations and the developments therein. The DA has been integral in countering the scourge of State Capture that has become endemic in the failing ANC government. This has been achieved through strong parliamentary oversight, the laying of criminal charges, strict reporting to the Public Protector and the driving of the creation of the Eskom Inquiry. To date, the DA has laid these charges against the following relevant personnel and entities: The police have a responsibility to investigate the charges against those who have been implicated in the looting of our state. On Tuesday, 27 November 2018, my colleague, DA Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele, and myself, will be visiting the Cape Town Central Police Station, in order to provide SAPS with additional information for the affidavits the DA has submitted thus far. We will be supplementing our existing cases with the evidence provided by the following chapters in the explosive Treasury Report: The DA will continue to fight for every rand that was stolen, so that every missing cent be returned to South Africa and so that those implicated in state capture are brought to book. South Africans want to see corrupted politicians, officials and corporates face the consequences of their actions and be put behind bars.

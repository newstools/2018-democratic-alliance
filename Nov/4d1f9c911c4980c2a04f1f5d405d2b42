We note that the Chief Executive Officer of the Public Investment Corporation Dr Dan Matjila’s offer to resign has been accepted and is effective immediately. However, this cannot be the end of the matter: it is imperative that the board makes all the facts surrounding his resignation public. We need to be sure there was no “golden handshake” and that he will not be allowed to escape and evade accountability for his actions at the Public Investment Corporation.

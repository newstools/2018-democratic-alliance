The DA would like to thank Phumzile van Damme for the incredible work she has done as the DA’s National Spokesperson (NSP) over the last four years. As the longest-serving NSP, she has shown immense dedication in what it is often a demanding job. She has travelled the length and breadth of South Africa delivering the DA message professionally and with passion and grace. While Ms van Damme has resigned from this position, for personal reasons, she remains the DA Shadow Minister of Communications where she will continue to conduct effective oversight as she has done and at which she has been highly successful. Refiloe Nt’sekhe will continue as the DA’s National Spokesperson, responsible for communicating on issues that crosscut or fall outside the portfolios of our shadow cabinet and will remain the first point of contact for members of the media.

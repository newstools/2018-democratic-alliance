Since the introduction of an extended and integrated service delivery strategy in Primary Health Care facilities that was launched by Mayor Herman Mashaba at Princess Clinic, Roodepoort in October 2016, the City has extended the service to 2 more clinics, namely Alexandra East Bank and Sinqobile Clinics, bringing the total to 13. Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Health and Social Development, Dr Mpho Phalatse said that Mayor Mashaba’s program to extend hours of service in the City clinics is a vital shift in how the City offers health care services and that the roll out will continue in stages. Phalatse said many of the City’s residents, who often had to choose between going to work and attending to their healthcare needs, now had a viable option.  Princess Clinic and Freedom Park Clinic, which are operating until 10pm on week days have seen over 30% more patients in the last six months (July 2017 to December 2017) and the number of patients who visit the clinics during weekends and public holidays is increasing steadily. Since July 2017 to December 2017, about 50 000 patients have been assisted after hours across the clinics, including weekends and public holidays and the number is rising. What is also important to note is that since the start of the program to extend operating hours, the waiting times have been declining, thus improving the quality of service to our patients.

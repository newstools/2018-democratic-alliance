ShotSpotter Technology, piloted in Helenvale since October 2017, entails the strategic placement of acoustic sensors that immediately inform law enforcement of gunshots and provides precise information of the location of the crime. The consideration for a broader roll-out of the R3 million project, follows seventeen arrests by the gang unit of the South African Police Services and arrests for attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms amongst others. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Safety and Security, Cllr John Best, said before the launch of this technology in October last year, a two-week trial period showed that 99% of the shots discharged in Helenvale are not reported to the police.  Statistics also show that the behaviour of the Helenvale community has significantly changed for the better as people are now able to occupy spaces that they would otherwise not have used due to the fear of gun violence.

The Public Protector has confirmed that Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Des van Rooyen, lied to parliament when he denied visiting the Gupta’s compound in Saxonwold in the run-up to his disastrous appointment as Finance Minister. The Public Protector, responding to the DA’s complaint in October 2016, that Van Rooyen is investigated, found that: The Public Protector has recommended that the President act against Van Rooyen, within 30 days and that the report is tabled in the National Assembly within 14 days of the President receiving the report. The DA has also recently written to House Chairperson, Cedric Frolick, to implore him to compel the Portfolio Committee for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs to institute a formal enquiry into the extent of State Capture in the Department as repeated requests to the Committee’s Chairperson, Hon. Richard Mdakane, have been routinely ignored. This can no longer be the case and the DA will ensure that all allegations of State Capture in CoGTA and thoroughly and urgently investigated.

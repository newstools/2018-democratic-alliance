The DA has today submitted an application to Multichoice in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) to request the full report it relied on for terminating its contract with Gupta-owned ANN7. The report compiled by MultiChoice’s Audit and Risk Committee must be made available to the public in the interest of openness and transparency, and in particular, to reveal the full details about why and how the payments were made to the Gupta-owned ANN7. The public deserves to know the full truth. Instead of providing substantial answers, Multichoice’s press briefing on Wednesday left the public with more questions than answers. If Multichoice has nothing to hide, it will willingly make this document public. Only the full truth will get Multichoice out of this mess. We need to know what “mistakes” were made, why no one is being held accountable and whether the money of those who are DSTV subscribers may have been used to grease Gupta palms. As it is clear that Multichoice has thus far declined to make the report public, the DA will now rely on the law to compel it to do so. The DA has submitted the PAIA application in terms of two sections of the Act namely: The DA also eagerly awaits a response from Multichoice. One, we trust, that will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

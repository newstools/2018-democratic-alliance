Six properties that were in the hands of hijackers have been handed back to their rightful owners in DA-led Jozi. It is alleged that one of the properties, situated in Forest Hill, was hijacked five years ago, with the other five properties hijacked between four and eight months ago. This brings the total number of hijacked properties that have been handed back to their owners to 18. The hand-over of the properties follows months of investigations by the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service department (GFIS), working together with the South African Police Service (SAPS). About 300 buildings are confirmed as hijacked in the City.  The City has conducted an audit of some 500 bad buildings. 24 of the 500 bad buildings belong to the City and 15 property hijackers have been arrested.

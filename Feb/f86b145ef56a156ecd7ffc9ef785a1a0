The DA supports a report submitted to the Constitutional Court this week by the panel of experts appointed to oversee SASSA’s readiness to take over the distribution of social grants. In its report, the panel has recommended that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation investigate the desirability of National Treasury taking over the payment of social grants, as well as the feasibility of SASSA or the Department of Social Development (DSD) taking over the functions of administration, registration and verification. The DA has in the past called on Treasury to take over the payment function from SASSA, as the agency has become compromised under the toxic influence of Minister Bathabile Dlamini. Some of the risks the panel have identified are: With less than two months until the April 1st deadline, these risks are very alarming. Last week, the South African Post Office CEO, Mark Barnes, accused the Minister of being “non-responsive and causing delays”; a further indication of an imminent crisis. SASSA and Minister Dlamini appears to be dragging their feet on finding an alternative service provider and there does not seem to be a clear plan of action. It is clear that we are fast approaching another social grants standoff – with Minister Dlamini, SASSA and CPS on one side and 17 million poor and vulnerable South Africans on the other side. The DA will always stand with the beneficiaries and we will not allow the Minister or anyone else to place their lives in jeopardy.

The DA welcomes that Shadow Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, Adv Glynnis Breytenbach, has today been acquitted of all charges against her. The DA has held that these charges were trumped up from the start. Magistrate Brian Nemavhidi, of the Pretoria Magistrates Court, found that Adv Breytenbach had broken no law and that the charges, relating to unauthorised access and changing official laptop contents while she was still at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), had no basis. The DA is satisfied that justice has prevailed, which should be celebrated.

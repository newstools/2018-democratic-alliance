The firm of attorneys whom received fraudulent transfers of over R800 000 from two employees who worked for the City of Johannesburg’s Group Finance Department, have returned the money back to the City of Johannesburg. This is not just a victory for the City, but a victory for Johannesburg residents and the rule of law. The City has laid charges against the two employees, and is on the trail of the external individuals that were a part of the syndicate. They will face the full might of the law. The Asset Forfeiture Unit will also ensure that funds are recouped, and that service delivery continues unhindered. Residents are encouraged to report any fraud and corruption activities through the City’s 24-hour tip-off hotline 0800 002 587 or visit the GFIS offices situated at 48 Ameshoff Street in Braamfontein.

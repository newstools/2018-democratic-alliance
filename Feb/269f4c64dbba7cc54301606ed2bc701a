The City of Johannesburg will soon complete the insourcing of 4 000 contract security workers, charged with keeping the City’s employees and buildings safe. This follows the DA-led administration’s commitment to bringing this crucial function into the City during the State of the City Address last year. The City of Johannesburg is undergoing an extensive process of ensuring the smooth integration of these security personnel into the City whilst guaranteeing the financial sustainability of the entire operation. Due to the complexities of local government regulations, cases of corruption, contractual commitments and legal considerations, the time taken to implement this process has been considerable.

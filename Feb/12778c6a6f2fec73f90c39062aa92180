Tomorrow, the National Assembly will debate the ninth, and the last, Motion of No Confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Jacob Zuma’s presidency has been characterised by all that is wrong in our society – grand corruption, crippling unemployment, and poverty on a scale like never before.  We have fought Jacob Zuma and all he represents for close on a decade now – beginning with the Spy Tapes court action in 2009. Finally, Parliament will perform its constitutional duty, and remove Jacob Zuma as President of our nation. I urge South Africans from all walks of life to fill the streets outside Parliament tomorrow as we unite across racial, religious, cultural and political lines to achieve a common good for our nation. Tomorrow’s Motion of No Confidence is not about politicians or their political parties. It’s about every single person who calls South Africa their home, and has been subject to the past nine years of Jacob Zuma’s disastrous reign. Details of the gathering are as follows: Date: Thursday, 15 February 2018 Time: 12h00 Location: Entrance to Parliament, corner of Roeland and Plein Street, Cape Town Tomorrow, let’s unite as South Africans and take a crucial step forward in our young democracy by removing Jacob Zuma, once and for all.

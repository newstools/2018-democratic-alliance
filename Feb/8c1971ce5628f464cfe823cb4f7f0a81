In 2017 the City of Tshwane established the TMPD Anti-Drug Unit with the sole purpose of fighting and eliminating drug abuse in the communities of Tshwane. One of the priority areas of the TMPD’s social crime prevention initiatives is drug awareness campaigns in schools and institutions within Tshwane, to ensure that learners as well as communities are informed about the dangers of drugs, while also encouraging them to come forward with information about drug suppliers or drug lords. The City’s Health Department is currently funding the Department of Home Medicine at the University of Pretoria, who developed the evidence based Community Oriented Substance Use Program (COSUP). To date, at least 2 364 people were enrolled on the COSUP programme and more than 12 000 follow-up visits were conducted for intensive interventions. It is estimated that the City has reached more than 40 000 people through outreach and education. Currently, the City operates seven Community Oriented Substance Use Programme sites in Mamelodi, Soshanguve, Hatfield, Daspoort, Atteridgeville, Eesterust and Sunnyside. A new site will be opened shortly in Olievenhoutbosch. Every day, the City’s 24-hour call centre, Hope Line, takes calls and refers callers for assistance The City also provides basic transport service, accommodation, food and blankets in case of emergencies. Callers in need of support are contacted and served by Social Workers who follow up on calls and ensure that the needs of callers are properly dealt with.

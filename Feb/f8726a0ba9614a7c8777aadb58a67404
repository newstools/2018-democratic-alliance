The DA welcomes media reports that former Acting National Police Commissioner, Khomotso Phahlane, his wife will hand themselves over to authorities in the morning. The couple, along with a businessman, face corruption and money laundering charges in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. Phahlane will finally face the music for charges relating to cars the couple received – allegedly as part of a corrupt scheme as well as allegations that Crimetech Laboratories paid for his stereo system worth R80 000. DA repeatedly called for investigations into Phahlane and called him to submit himself to a voluntary lifestyle audit which he diligently dodged. This bodes well for holding Phahlane to account but the fact remains that those chosen to lead the South African Police Service (SAPS) leadership need to be above reproach so that the public can trust that they will be committed to fighting the unacceptably high levels of crime in our country – not contribute to it. It is high time that Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, prioritises keeping the people of South African safe by ensuring that those entrusted to bring down crime rates have the skills and experience to do so.
